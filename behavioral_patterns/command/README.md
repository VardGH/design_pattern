**Command Pattern**

The Command pattern decouples the sender of a request from the receiver, by encapsulating a request as an object. This allows for parameterizing clients with different requests, queuing or logging requests, and supporting undoable operations.

**Components:**

1. **Receiver Class:**
   This class represents the entity that receives and processes the commands. In this example, it has two methods, `open_file` and `close_file`, which simulate opening and closing a file.

2. **Command Interface:**
   The `Command` class represents the interface for all concrete command classes. It declares a single pure virtual method, `execute()`, which must be implemented by each concrete command class.

3. **Concrete Command Classes:**
   - `OpenFileCommand` and `CloseFileCommand` are two concrete command classes that implement the `Command` interface. Each of these classes encapsulates a specific action (opening or closing a file) and delegates it to the receiver.

4. **Invoker Class:**
   The `Invoker` class contains a collection of command objects and has a method, `execute_commands()`, to execute the stored commands in sequence.

**How to Use:**

1. Create an instance of the `Receiver` class, which will handle the actual operations that the commands will execute.

2. Create instances of the concrete command classes (`OpenFileCommand` and `CloseFileCommand`), passing the receiver object and any required parameters to their constructors.

3. Create an instance of the `Invoker` class, which will store the command objects.

4. Add the command objects to the invoker using the `add_command()` method.

5. Execute the commands by calling the `execute_commands()` method of the invoker. The invoker will then execute each command in the order they were added.
