# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns in software engineering that focus on the interaction and communication between objects. These patterns help manage the behavior and responsibilities of objects in a flexible and efficient way, promoting good object-oriented design principles. Behavioral patterns facilitate communication, collaboration, and delegation among objects, making the system more maintainable and scalable.

This repository provides examples and explanations of various behavioral design patterns implemented in C++. Each pattern has its unique purpose and usage, and understanding them can improve the way you design and organize your software components.

## List of Behavioral Patterns

1. **Strategy Pattern:**
   - The Strategy pattern allows a client to choose a specific algorithm from a family of algorithms dynamically. It promotes loose coupling by encapsulating each algorithm in separate classes and enabling runtime switching of strategies.

2. **Command Pattern:**
   - The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing clients to parameterize objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and undo/redo operations. It decouples senders and receivers, promoting extensibility.

3. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern:**
   - The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows multiple objects to handle a request in a chain. The request is passed along the chain until an object handles it or the end of the chain is reached. This pattern reduces coupling and provides flexibility in handling requests.

4. **Mediator Pattern:**
   - The Mediator pattern promotes loose coupling between objects by centralizing communication between them through a mediator. It allows objects to interact without having direct references to each other, enhancing maintainability and flexibility.


5. **Visitor Pattern:**
   - The Visitor pattern separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It allows adding new operations to a group of classes without modifying their structure. The Visitor pattern is particularly useful when dealing with complex object structures.
