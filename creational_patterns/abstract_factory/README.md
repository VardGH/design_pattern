**Abstract Factory Design Pattern: Furniture Factory**

The main goal of this pattern is to provide an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Classes:**

1. `Chair`: An abstract class representing a chair with a pure virtual function `sit()`, which is meant to be overridden by concrete chair classes.

2. `ModernChair`, `VictorianChair`, `ArtDecoChair`: Concrete chair classes, each representing a specific type of chair with its own implementation of the `sit()` method.

3. `Sofa`: An abstract class representing a sofa with a pure virtual function `lie_down()`, which is meant to be overridden by concrete sofa classes.

4. `ModernSofa`, `VictorianSofa`, `ArtDecoSofa`: Concrete sofa classes, each representing a specific type of sofa with its own implementation of the `lie_down()` method.

5. `CoffeeTable`: An abstract class representing a coffee table with a pure virtual function `drink_coffee()`, which is meant to be overridden by concrete coffee table classes.

6. `ModernCoffeeTable`, `VictorianCoffeeTable`, `ArtDecoCoffeeTable`: Concrete coffee table classes, each representing a specific type of coffee table with its own implementation of the `drink_coffee()` method.

7. `FurnitureFactory`: An abstract factory class with three pure virtual functions: `create_chair()`, `create_sofa()`, and `create_coffee_table()`. Concrete subclasses of `FurnitureFactory` will provide implementations for these functions to create specific families of furniture.

8. `ModernFurnitureFactory`, `VictorianFurnitureFactory`, `ArtDecoFurnitureFactory`: Concrete factory classes, each representing a factory that can create a family of modern, Victorian, or Art Deco furniture, respectively.

**Client Code:**

The `client_code()` function is the client's entry point for creating furniture. It takes a reference to a `FurnitureFactory` and uses it to create a chair, sofa, and coffee table. Then it calls the appropriate methods on these furniture objects.

**Usage:**

1. To create and use modern furniture, create an instance of `ModernFurnitureFactory`, pass it to the `client_code()` function, and delete the factory after use.

2. To create and use Victorian furniture, create an instance of `VictorianFurnitureFactory`, pass it to the `client_code()` function, and delete the factory after use.

3. To create and use Art Deco furniture, create an instance of `ArtDecoFurnitureFactory`, pass it to the `client_code()` function, and delete the factory after use.

Remember to handle memory cleanup by deleting the furniture objects created by the factories.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs or extend it to include additional types of furniture.
